# A Guide to Algorithms in JavaScript

## What This Is

The markdown files in this repo are a general guide to JavaScript algorithms. Much of this content originated as notes for Colt Steele's [Algorithm & Data Structures Bootcamp course](https://www.udemy.com/course/js-algorithms-and-data-structures-masterclass/) on Udemy.

- [Frequency Counter](https://repl.it/@zhaluza/Frequency-Counter)
  - Creates separate objects to count the frequency of individual elements in separate arguments.
- [Pointers](https://repl.it/@zhaluza/Pointers)
  - This technique creates pointers that correspond to an index or position and move towards the beginning, end, or middle based on a certain condition.
- [Sliding Window](https://repl.it/@zhaluza/Sliding-Window)
  - This pattern involves creating a window, which can either be an array or number spanning from one position to another.
  - Depending on a certain condition, the window either widens or closes (and a new window is created).
  - Useful for keeping track of a subset of data in an array or string.
